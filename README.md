# Matrix-todo-app-react
This is my finished To-Do app, made in React. As my first working React app I am very proud of it. It may not be for your taste, but I like the look's of it very, very much.

It's nothing spectacular, just a couple of components and nice UI. Furthermore, it's not responsive, I didn't bother to make it responsive, my goal was to build a working React app, and I managed to do it. It uses local storage so all my ToDos are always there. Later I maybe add an option to create an account and make it responsive.

Here is uploaded version on Netlify. https://matrix-todo.netlify.app/

Here, on GitHub I just uploaded Build code.


Don't ask me how to turn on PC ;)
