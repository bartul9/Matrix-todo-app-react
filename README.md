# Matrix-todo-app-react
This is my finished ToDo app, made in React. As my first working React app I am very proud of it. It may not be for your taste but I like the look's of it very, very much.

It's nothing spectacular, just couple of components and nice UI. It's not responsive, I didn't bother to make it responsive, my goal was to build working React app, and I managed to do it. 

Here is uploaded version on Netlify. https://matrix-todo.netlify.app/

Here, on GitHub I just uploaded Build code.
